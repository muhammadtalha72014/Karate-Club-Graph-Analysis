🥋 Karate Club Graph Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Karate Club dataset using various graph statistics. The key tasks and features analyzed in this task include:

📊 Average Degree: Calculation of the average number of connections per node in the graph.
👥 Number of Classes: Determination of the number of distinct groups or communities within the Karate Club network.
🔗 Clustering Coefficient: Measurement of the degree to which nodes in the graph tend to cluster together.
🌐 Closeness Centrality: Evaluation of how close each node is to all other nodes in the network.
📈 Degree Distribution: Analysis of the frequency distribution of node degrees.
🔝 Betweenness Centrality: Identification of nodes that act as bridges between different parts of the network.
📉 Eigenvector Centrality: Assessment of the influence of a node based on the importance of its neighbors.

Additionally, link-level features were computed to further understand the relationships between pairs of nodes in the dataset.

This analysis provides insights into the structure and characteristics of the Karate Club network, revealing important aspects of social interactions within the club.
